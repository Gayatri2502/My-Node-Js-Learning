Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform
 JavaScript runtime environment
 that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, it is often used for web applications
.
Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
, which makes it very fast and efficient. Node.js is also very lightweight, making it ideal for use on small devices like smartphones and tablets.
Node.js is event-driven, which means that it can handle multiple requests at the same time without blocking. This makes it ideal for real-time applications like chat and messaging.
Node.js is also very popular for building APIs. APIs are a way for two pieces of software to communicate with each other. Node.js is a great choice for building APIs because it is fast, efficient, and easy to use.
